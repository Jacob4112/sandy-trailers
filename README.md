// Simply put this resource into your resources folder but don't forget to start it in your server.cfg!

// Please bookmark the github page, I will be releasing updates and hotfixes for the floating objects. In regards to the floating objects it's only about 2 of them and they aren't outside of the RV's only on the inside, it will be fixed soon!

// 2/21/2021 v1.1 - fixed some colliding props, still failed to fix the floating laptops but they aren’t that big of an eyesore because they’re inside the trailers.
